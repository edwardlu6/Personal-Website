        Sound quality was the main problem. Lennon’s voice shared the recorded track with a murky-sounding piano. But in the 2020s, the software that Peter Jackson used to isolate instruments and voices from mono tracks for his 2021 “Get Back” documentary series could also extract and clarify Lennon’s lead vocal. Back in the studio, McCartney and Starr completed “Now and Then” using tracks from 1995, new parts recorded in 2022, a new string-orchestra arrangement and — from the Beatles’ session archives — backing vocals from “Here, There and Everywhere,” “Eleanor Rigby” and “Because”: “oohs” and “ahs” in harmony.
        For all the multitrack machinations, it’s Lennon’s open longing that carries “Now and Then.” He sings, “If I make it through, it’s all because of you” to a partner, friend or lover who’s gone away, perhaps forever. “Now and then I want you to be there for me/Always to return to me.”

        The melody is plaintive, in a minor key. The multi-decade arrangement starts straightforwardly, with steadfast piano, guitar and drums — hinting at “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” — and then vastly expands with orchestral strings. McCartney, who understands the Beatles’ musical mechanics from deep within, replayed Lennon’s piano parts, and for the bridge he overdubbed a slide-guitar solo like something Harrison might have played. The muscular string arrangement, no doubt deliberately, echoes songs like “I Am the Walrus” and “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.”
